Readability Buttons displays readability.com official button on your sidebar.

== Description ==
Readability Buttons displays readability.com official button on your sidebar. I use the simplest way to insert the codes for you, no sql strings will be inserted, no options to configure, you probably need this plugin if you're runing a WordPress multisite and want your users to add readability.com script by themselves.
